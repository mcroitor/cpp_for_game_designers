## VI. METHODICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHING-LEARNING-EVALUATION

The activity of teaching-learning at the discipline "C++ Programming" is organized as a theoretical lessons, laboratory work and individual work (independent activity of the student).

The teaching activity on the theoretical lessons is realized as a combination of traditional forms of instruction (exposition, conversation, exercise, reading (explanatory, directed), activity with the manual and other books) with modern approaches to knowledge in the process of communication and cooperation, in which students have an active role (computer-assisted instruction, lecture-debate, algorithm composing, problematization, brainstorming, programmed instruction, simulation methods). The teacher contributes to the formation and development of functional competencies, such as skills for processing, systematizing, restructuring and using knowledge in practice, cultivating a participatory spirit, forming and developing the capacity to investigate reality, argumentative capacity and decision-making capacity.

At the laboratory lessons and at the individual work tasks are proposed tasks that cover the entire studied material, with the aim of capitalizing and deepening knowledge, stimulating learning activity centered on the student. At the laboratory lessons traditional methods are used (exercise, problem solving, algorithm composing, practical work) and some specific methods and techniques, including interactive ones, for solving mathematical problems, techniques based on creative problem solving, methods and techniques for developing communication competence (feedback analysis, etc.). The teacher gives students opportunities to freely express their ideas and opinions and confront them with those of their colleagues.

The time allocated for the independent work of students is intended for the preparation of theoretical lessons and laboratory work, current tasks and realization of independent works (case study, research project).

The evaluation of the students' knowledge in the "C++ Programming" course has a formative character

- the activity in the laboratory lessons, the oral or written current evaluation;
- two intermediate attestations (in the middle and at the end of the semester);
- a summative final grade - 6 works related to each other, carried out during the semester and
- the final exam.

Each theoretical lesson is supported by 20 knowledge-level questions and 10 application-level questions.

After every seven theoretical lessons, an attestation is organized, which includes 10 knowledge-level questions and 5 application-level questions from the previous topics.

The final exam is organized in the form of a test, which includes 20 knowledge-level questions, 10 application-level questions, and 2 integration-level questions (programming) from the studied topics.

The final grade sums up the exam grade and the semester grade, in a proportion of 40% and 60%, respectively, and assesses the degree of correspondence with the expected outcomes: knowledge and skills acquired, ability to apply knowledge, degree of integration of knowledge by students etc.
