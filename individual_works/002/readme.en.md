# Creating and Using Classes. Multi-file Projects. Project Build.

## Objective

By completing this assignment, the student becomes familiar with the specifics of class implementation and interaction with class objects. The student also obtains basic knowledge about building projects from the command line.

## Task

The assignment is performed based on the previous laboratory work. All changes are made in the `lab02` branch of the repository.

Perform the following actions:

1. For each defined data structure, implement the declared methods;
2. Compile one of the CPP files from the command line, creating an object file;
3. Create a `make.cmd` or `Makefile` file for manual project build;
4. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude files generated during the build process from the repository;
5. Update the `README.md` file, adding information about project build;
6. Upload the modified code to GitHub in the `lab02` branch.

## Submission

To submit your result, attach a link to your GitHub repository to the assignment in Moodle.

## Grading

- `2p` – implementation of methods for data types;
- `2p` – creation of a project build file;
- `1p` – creation of a `.gitignore` file;
- `1p` – the project build method is described in the `README.md` file;
- `2p` –  `.cpp` files and the build file are added to GitHub in the `lab02` branch;
- `2p` – the work is presented and defended;
- `-1p` – for each day of late submission;
- `-5p` – for plagiarism.
