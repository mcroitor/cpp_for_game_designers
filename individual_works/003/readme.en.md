# Constructors and Operators

## Objective

In this assignment, the student learns how to override operators and becomes familiar with the options for defining and using constructors.

Additionally, this assignment prepares the project for using the C++ Standard Library.

## Task

The assignment is performed based on the previous laboratory work.

For each data structure representing game elements, define:

1. default constructor;
2. copy constructor;
3. parameterized constructor;
4. assignment operator;
5. comparison operators;
6. input and output operators;
7. For the class responsible for rendering game objects, define an abstract base class.

## Submission

To submit your result, attach a link to your GitHub repository to the assignment in Moodle.

## Grading

- `1p` - implementation of constructors;
- `1p` - implementation of the assignment operator;
- `2p` - implementation of comparison operators;
- `2p` - implementation of input and output operators;
- `2p` - implementation of the base abstract class;
- `2p` - the work is presented and defended;
- `-1p` - for each day of late submission;
- `-5p` - for plagiarism.
