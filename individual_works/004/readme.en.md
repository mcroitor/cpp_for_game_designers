# Using the C++ Standard Library

## Objective

In this assignment, the student becomes familiar with the C++ Standard Library.

## Task

The assignment is performed based on the previous laboratory work, in the `lab04` branch.

Rewrite the code of your game so that:

- instead of C-style arrays (`int opt[4]`, `double* bag`), containers are used;
- STL algorithms are used (search, comparison, copying, sorting, etc.);
- `std::string` is used instead of `char*`.

Avoid using pointers and dynamic memory; instead, use references, smart pointers, and containers.

Submit the result of your work to GitHub in the `lab04` branch.

## Submission

To submit your result, attach a link to your GitHub repository to the assignment in Moodle.

## Grading

- `2p` – use of STL containers;
- `1p` – use of `std::string`;
- `1p` – use of input/output streams;
- `2p` – use of smart pointers / references;
- `2p` – use of STL algorithms;
- `2p` - the work is presented and defended;
- `-1p` - for each day of late submission;
- `-5p` – for plagiarism.
