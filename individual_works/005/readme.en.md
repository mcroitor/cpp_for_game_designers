# Creating and Using Modules / Libraries

## Objective

By completing this assignment, the student becomes familiar with the specifics of creating programming libraries and their usage.

## Task

The assignment is performed based on the previous laboratory work, in the `lab05` branch.

Make the following changes to the project:

1. For each class representing data, create a separate library (dynamic or static, at your choice).
2. Use third-party libraries for drawing graphics (SFML, SDL, fltk) or for data storage (json, yaml-cpp, sqlite3).
3. Rewrite the build file so that the application is built using the created libraries.

Upload the result of your work to GitHub in the `lab05` branch.

## Submission

To submit your result, attach a link to your GitHub repository to the assignment in Moodle.

## Grading

- `3p` – creation of libraries;
- `3p` – usage of libraries;
- `2p` – updating the build file;
- `2p` - the work is presented and defended;
- `-1p` - for each day of late submission;
- `-5p` - for plagiarism.
