# Project Maintenance. Writing Documentation. Writing Tests

## Objective

In this assignment, the student becomes familiar with the requirements for code maintenance.

## Task

The assignment is performed based on the previous laboratory work, in the `lab06` branch.

Document the code using the `Doxygen` system or a similar tool.

Each header file must contain:

- meta-information (project name, author, year, etc.);
- a description of the class (or other data type);
- a description of the methods.

The project `README.md` file must contain:

- a description of the task;
- a description of the game rules;
- a list of project dependencies (development environment, compiler, third-party libraries used);
- a description of the application build process.

Create a `tests` folder and write unit tests for the data classes using one of the testing frameworks (Google Test, Catch2, or similar). Update the build file so that tests can be built and run.

Upload the result of your work to GitHub in the `lab06` branch.

## Submission

To submit your result, attach a link to your GitHub repository to the assignment in Moodle.

## Grading

- `3p` – use of a code documentation system;
- `2p` – project description in the `README.md` file;
- `3p` – presence of unit tests;
- `2p` - the work is presented and defended;
- `-1p` - for each day of late submission;
- `-5p` - for plagiarism.
