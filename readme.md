# C++ Programming Course

## Description

This repository contains a summary and materials for the _C++ Programming Course_. The course is designed for second-year students, majoring in "Game Development". During the course, students will learn about:

- the basics of C++;
- object-oriented programming;
- the C++ standard library;
- programming libraries usage;
- creation of complex applications in C++.

During the course student will accumulate the following knowledge and skills:

- understanding the basic constructions of the C++ language;
- ability to create classes and use object-oriented principles;
- ability to use the C++ standard library;
- ability to create complex (modular) applications in C++;
- creation of C++ projects;
- building C++ applications;
- Source version control using GIT;
- writing documentation;
- usage of third-party libraries.

Also student will create his own game in C++.

The course is designed for 15 theoretical classes and 22 laboratory classes.
